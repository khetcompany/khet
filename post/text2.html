    <h1>About Text2</h1>

    <p>
        Text2 is a growing collective of creators, engineers, and innovators who share a single mission:
        <strong>build things that actually matter.</strong>
        We don’t limit ourselves to a specific field — if it brings value to users, we make it.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Vision</h2>
    <p>
        At Text2, stepping into the arena is everything. Whether it’s software, mobile applications, hardware experiments,
        or digital content, each project contributes to what we proudly call the <em>Text2 Ecosystem</em>.
    </p>

    <h2>The Ecosystem</h2>
    <p>
        The Text2 Ecosystem includes every tool, idea, and product we create — visible or behind the scenes. 
        From internal utilities to public platforms, all of it reflects our drive to shape meaningful technology.
    </p>

    <h2>The Team</h2>
    <p>
        We’re an open team built on collaboration and curiosity. No strict requirements, no rigid structure.
        Anyone with motivation can contribute and grow with us. The goal is simple:
        <strong>build solutions that genuinely solve user problems.</strong>
    </p>
